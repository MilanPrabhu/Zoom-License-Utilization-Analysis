Organization: OnLok Healthcare · San Francisco, CA
Tools: Splunk, Splunk SPL, SQL
Outcome: 40% reduction in unnecessary Zoom license costs

Overview
OnLok Healthcare was overspending on Zoom licenses across multiple departments and office locations. Many licenses were assigned to employees who rarely used Zoom or were located at sites with existing Zoom Rooms available — meaning individual licenses were redundant.
I was tasked with analyzing Zoom usage patterns across the HR department to identify which licenses were underutilized and build a business case for reallocation.

What I Did

Connected to raw Zoom event log data and built structured SPL (Splunk Search Processing Language) queries to aggregate usage at the department and employee level
Engineered metrics including meeting frequency, meeting duration, Zoom Room availability by location, and employment type to identify reallocation candidates
Built an interactive Splunk dashboard to visualize license utilization patterns across office locations and employee categories
Delivered a prioritized list of license reassignment recommendations to the IT and operations teams based on behavioral and location signals
